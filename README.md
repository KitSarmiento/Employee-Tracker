# Employee-Tracker

This week's project involves creating a command-line application using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL to manage a company's employee database.

## Description

Content management systems (CMS) are interfaces designed to enable individuals without coding expertise to view and interact with data stored in databases seamlessly. With the use of Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL, a command-line application can be developed from scratch to manage an organization's employee database.

## Installation

No installation is required for this project. Please refer to the usage section for instructions on how to use the project.

## Usage

To utilize this app, access the integrated terminal and input either "npm start" or "node server.js" command. This will provide a list of options for the employee tracker, allowing the user to view, add, and delete employees, departments, and roles as needed. Additionally, users can update employee roles and managers, and obtain the total department budget. Once all necessary prompts are answered, the application will notify the user of successful execution or display an error message if necessary.
